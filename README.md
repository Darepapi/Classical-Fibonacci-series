# Classical-Fibonacci-series 
A Classical Fibonacci series (Series of number which always add first value to the next in line, subsequently like that..) that keeps record of your result and recalculates the length of your value.  Final, saves everything in a well formatted text file dump right at your desktop folder. All Exceptions are well handled!
